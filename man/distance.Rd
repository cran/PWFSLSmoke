\title{Calculate the Distance Between Points}
\usage{
distance(targetLon, targetLat, lons, lats)
}
\arguments{
\item{targetLon}{longitude (decimal degrees) of the point from which distances are calculated}

\item{targetLat}{latitude (decimal degrees) of the point from which distances are calculated}

\item{lons}{vector of longitudes (decimal degrees) for which a distance is calculated}

\item{lats}{vector of latitudes (decimal degrees) for which a distance is calculated}
}
\value{
Vector of distances in km.
}
\description{
This funciton uses the Haversine forumula for calculating great
circle distances between points. This formula is purpoted to work better
than the spherical law of cosines for very short distances.

# Seattle to Portland airports
SEA_lon <- -122.3088
SEA_lat <- 47.4502
PDX_lon <- -122.5951
PDX_lat <- 45.5898
distance(SEA_lon, SEA_lat, PDX_lon, PDX_lat)
