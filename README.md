# PWFSLSmoke R Package

```
Utilities for Working with Air Quality Monitoring Data
```

## Background

The USFS Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Lab [AirFire](https://www.airfire.org) team works
to model wildland fire emissions and has created the BlueSky Modeling Framework. This
system  integrates a wide collection of models along a smoke modeling pipeline (fire 
information, fuel loadings, consumption modeling, emissions modeling, time rate of 
emissions modeling, plume height estimations, and smoke trajectory and dispersion 
modeling). The resulting model output has been integrated into many different smoke 
prediction systems and scientific modeling efforts.

The **PWFSLSmoke** R package is being developed for PWFSL to help modelers and scientists
more easily work with PM2.5 data from monitoring locations across North America.

The package makes it easier to obtain data, perform analyses and generate reports. It includes functionality to:

 * download and easily work with regulatory PM2.5 data from AirNow
 * download and quality control raw monitoring data from other sources
 * convert between UTC and local timezones
 * apply various algorithms to the data (nowcast, rolling means, aggregation, etc.)
 * provide interactive timeseries and maps through RStudioâ€™s Viewer pane
 * create a variety of publication ready maps and timeseries plots

## Installation

This package is designed to be used with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) (>= 3.1.0) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) so make sure you have those installed first.

Users will want to install the **devtools** package to have access to latest versions
of some packages that are not yet available on CRAN.

The following packages should be installed with devtools by typing the following at the RStudio console:

```
# Note that vignettes require knitr and rmarkdown
install.packages('knitr')
install.packages('rmarkdown')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/dygraphs')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/leaflet')
devtools::install_github('mazamascience/MazamaSpatialUtils', build_vignettes=TRUE)
devtools::install_github('mazamascience/PWFSLSmoke', build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

Any work with spatial data, *e.g.* assigning counties or watersheds, will require installation of required
spatial datasets. To get these datasets you should execute the following commands from a shell terminal:

```
mkdir ~/Data
cd ~/Data
curl -O http://mazamascience.com/RData/Spatial.tar.gz
tar -xzf Spatial.tar.gz
```

## Examples

Additional vignettes that demonstrate the functionality of the package can be found in the
[localVignettes](https://github.com/MazamaScience/PWFSLSmoke/tree/master/localVignettes)
directory on github. These vignettes are not part of the package because they require
installation of the **MazamaSpatialUtils** datasets.

To run them you should:

 * make sure you have the proper spatial data installed in ~/Data/Spatial/
 * make sure you have both the **knitr** and **rmarkdown** packages installed
 * download the localVignettes
 * load one into RStudio
 * click the "Knit" button
